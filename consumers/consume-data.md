# Consume Data

Pyth price feeds can be consumed in both off- and on-chain applications, and is available on several different chains.

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend reading the [Best Practices](best-practices.md) documentation before using Pyth in your application, to ensure you are using the data safely.
{% endhint %}

## On-Chain Programs
{% content-ref url="solana.md" %}
[solana.md](solana.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="terra.md" %}
[terra.md](terra.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Off-Chain Programs
Pyth price feeds can be used in off-chain programs, using one of our [Solana off-chain client libraries](solana.md#off-chain-clients). Client libraries exist for JavaScript, Rust, Python and Go.
