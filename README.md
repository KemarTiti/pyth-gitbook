# Introduction

Pyth is an oracle that publishes continuous real-world financial and crypto market data. High-fidelity, first party data originating off-chain is supplied at sub-second speeds with [sophisticated aggregation](how-pyth-works/price-aggregation.md) that can both capture data richness and indicate conviction.

Our price feeds can be consumed by on-chain programs and off-chain applications, and are available on the Solana and Terra blockchains. We are working to bring Pyth price feeds to many more chains in the near future.

## Get Started
We have several different guides to get started with Pyth, depending on your use case.
