# Introduction

Pyth is an oracle that publishes continuous real-world financial and crypto market data. High-fidelity, first party data originating off-chain is supplied at sub-second speeds with [sophisticated aggregation](how-pyth-works/price-aggregation.md) that can both capture data richness and indicate conviction.

This price data can be consumed by on-chain programs and off-chain applications, and is available on Solana, Terra and BSC.

**Getting Started**

We have several different guides to get started with Pyth depending on your use case:

* To learn more about the Pyth Network, read the Pyth Network Summary, Network Participants, Network Interactions, Claims Process, and Participant Incentives sections.&#x20;
* To consume Pyth data in on- or off-chain applications, use one of the [Client Libraries](consumers/client-libraries.md) available in multiple programming languages.
* To provide first-party data to Pyth, see the [Getting Started](publishers/getting-started.md) guide for publishers.&#x20;
* For a high-level explanation of Pyth's architecture, see the [Design Overview](how-pyth-works/design-overview.md).
