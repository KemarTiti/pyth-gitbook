# Introduction

Pyth is an oracle that publishes continuous real-world financial and crypto market data. High-fidelity, first party data originating off-chain is supplied at sub-second speeds with [sophisticated aggregation](how-pyth-works/price-aggregation.md) that can both capture data richness and indicate conviction.

This price data can be consumed by on-chain programs and off-chain applications, and is available on Solana, Terra and BSC.
