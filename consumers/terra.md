# Pyth on Terra

Pyth is currently live on Terra Testnet. The [pyth-sdk-terra crate](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-sdk-rs/tree/main/pyth-sdk-terra) crate lets you consume Pyth prices in Terra programs. An example contract can be found [here](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-sdk-rs/tree/main/examples/terra-contract).
