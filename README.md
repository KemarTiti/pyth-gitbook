# Introduction

Pyth is an oracle that publishes continuous real-world financial and crypto market data. **High-fidelity, first party data** originating off-chain is supplied at sub-second speeds with [cross-chain publishing](https://pythnetwork.medium.com/pyth-x-wormhole-6b7c17e18469) and [sophisticated aggregation](https://pythnetwork.medium.com/what-is-confidence-uncertainty-in-a-price-649583b598cf) that can both capture data richness and indicate conviction. This price data can be consumed by on-chain programs and off-chain applications.

The Pyth network is native on the [Solana](https://solana.com) blockchain, which allows data providers to continuously update prices at every slot: that’s once every [400ms](https://solana.com) — more than 200,000 updates daily. Furthermore, the network's throughput will increase over time with Solana’s scaling. The network's prices will also be available on Ethereum, BSC, and Terra, thanks to [Wormhole](https://solana.com/wormhole).

**Getting Started**

We have several different guides to get started with Pyth depending on your use case:

* To learn more about the Pyth Network, read the Pyth Network Summary, Network Participants, Network Interactions, Claims Process, and Participant Incentives sections.&#x20;
* To consume Pyth data in on- or off-chain applications, use one of the [Client Libraries](consumers/client-libraries.md) available in multiple programming languages.
* To provide first-party data to Pyth, see the [Getting Started](publishers/getting-started.md) guide for publishers.&#x20;
* For a high-level explanation of Pyth's architecture, see the [Design Overview](how-pyth-works/design-overview.md).
